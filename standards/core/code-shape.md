# Code Shape

This page covers the default expectations for local code structure and readability.

## Prefer Early Returns Over Nesting

- Level: `should`
- Intent: Keep control flow shallow so the main path remains obvious.
- Rule: Prefer guard clauses and early returns over nested conditionals. Exit invalid or boring paths first and keep the main behavior at the left margin.
- Rationale: Deep nesting hides the core behavior, makes refactors riskier, and increases the amount of state a reader has to carry through the function.
- Good example:

```rust
fn send_receipt(maybe_order: Option<Order>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let Some(order) = maybe_order else {
        return Ok(());
    };

    if !order.is_paid {
        return Ok(());
    }

    deliver(order)
}
```

- Bad example:

```rust
fn send_receipt(maybe_order: Option<Order>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    if let Some(order) = maybe_order {
        if order.is_paid {
            deliver(order)?;
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

- Exceptions or escape hatches: A small amount of nesting is acceptable when it matches the shape of the problem better than a sequence of guard clauses. The goal is clarity, not mechanical flattening.
- Review questions: Can the unhappy path exit sooner? Is the main behavior indented because guards were left inline?
- Automation potential: Linters can catch some unnecessary nesting patterns, but readability still needs reviewer judgment.

## Use Language-Native Guard Constructs

- Level: `should`
- Intent: Express guard-style exits with the clearest construct each language offers.
- Rule: When a language has dedicated guard constructs, prefer them over more indirect control flow. In Rust, use `let...else` when destructuring or extracting values for an early exit makes the function easier to read.
- Rationale: Guard constructs communicate intent directly and reduce ceremony around the "continue only when this value is present or valid" pattern.
- Good example:

```rust
fn issue_refund(maybe_payment: Option<Payment>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let Some(payment) = maybe_payment else {
        return Ok(());
    };

    if !payment.is_refundable() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    process_refund(payment)
}
```

- Bad example:

```rust
fn issue_refund(maybe_payment: Option<Payment>) -> Result<(), Error> {
    if maybe_payment.is_none() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    let payment = maybe_payment.unwrap();

    if !payment.is_refundable() {
        return Ok(());
    }

    process_refund(payment)
}
```

- Exceptions or escape hatches: If `match`, `if let`, or another form is genuinely clearer for multiple branches, use it. This rule is about clarity, not forcing every extraction through the same syntax.
- Review questions: Is the guard expression direct, or is the function split between a presence check and a later extraction? Does the code use the clearest language feature for the shape of the control flow?
- Automation potential: Rust-specific linting or review tooling can flag some `let...else` opportunities, but not all cases are equally readable.

## Split Large Functions Into Named Pieces

- Level: `should`
- Intent: Keep functions small enough that a reader can understand one concern at a time.
- Rule: When a function grows beyond roughly 200 lines, treat that as a refactor trigger. Break it into sensible helpers, steps, or sub-workflows with names that reveal intent.
- Rationale: Oversized functions usually mix responsibilities, bury important transitions, and make testing harder because the seams are implicit instead of named.
- Good example:

```text
handleCheckout()
  -> parseRequest()
  -> priceCart()
  -> reserveInventory()
  -> buildResponse()
```

- Bad example:

```text
handleCheckout()
  // 230+ lines that parse input, calculate discounts, mutate stock,
  // call payment APIs, map errors, log metrics, and build the response
```

- Exceptions or escape hatches: Generated code and intentionally linear scripts may exceed the threshold. If a larger function is still the clearest representation, leave a short note explaining why splitting it would hurt clarity.
- Review questions: Does the function still represent a single concern? Could named helpers reveal the workflow better than comments or blank lines?
- Automation potential: Length checks are easy to automate, but whether the split is sensible still requires review.

## Keep Workflow Config Thin And Extract Non-Trivial Scripts

- Level: `should`
- Intent: Keep automation config readable and make non-trivial workflow logic locally runnable, reusable, and testable.
- Rule: Keep workflow or automation YAML focused on orchestration. When a workflow step grows into non-trivial script logic such as multiline shell with branching, loops, parsing, reusable logic, or more than trivial glue, extract it into a checked-in script or language-native entrypoint in a sensible repo location like `scripts/`, `tools/`, or the relevant package.
- Rationale: Inline workflow scripts are hard to review, awkward to debug locally, and easy to duplicate across jobs. Extracted scripts can be named, tested, linted, reused, and run outside the CI system.
- Good example:

```yaml
- name: Verify docs
  run: ./scripts/verify-docs.sh
```

- Bad example:

```yaml
- name: Verify docs
  run: |
    set -euo pipefail
    changed=0
    for path in README.md standards/**/*.md templates/**/*.md; do
      if [[ ! -f "$path" ]]; then
        continue
      fi
      npx markdownlint-cli2 "$path"
      if grep -q "TODO" "$path"; then
        changed=1
      fi
    done

    if [[ "$changed" -eq 1 ]]; then
      python3 scripts/check-links.py --strict
    else
      python3 scripts/check-links.py
    fi
```

- Exceptions or escape hatches: Short glue commands, obvious one-liners, or tiny invocations of existing tools may stay inline. If a reusable composite action or existing third-party action is clearer than a local script, prefer the clearer abstraction.
- Review questions: Is this YAML still orchestration, or is it hiding script logic? Would the logic be easier to reuse, test, lint, or run locally from `scripts/`, `tools/`, or a language-native entrypoint?
- Automation potential: Linters can flag large multiline `run:` blocks, but deciding when the logic has crossed from glue into a script still needs reviewer judgment.

## Split Oversized Files Into Modules

- Level: `should`
- Intent: Keep file boundaries aligned with coherent responsibilities instead of turning one file into a dumping ground.
- Rule: When a source file grows beyond roughly 628 lines of code, treat that as a refactor trigger. Split it into smaller modules organized around clear responsibilities.
- Rationale: Very large files slow navigation, hide architectural seams, and often signal that unrelated concerns have accumulated in one place.
- Good example:

```text
checkout/
  pricing.rs
  validation.rs
  orchestration.rs
  tests.rs
```

- Bad example:

```text
checkout.rs
  // request parsing
  // pricing rules
  // tax logic
  // API adapter
  // persistence
  // error mapping
  // tests
```

- Exceptions or escape hatches: Some files act as intentionally central registries or protocol definitions. Keep those rare, obvious, and documented.
- Review questions: Does the file contain multiple clusters of logic that would be easier to navigate as separate modules? Are tests, adapters, and domain rules all mixed together?
- Automation potential: File-length checks are easy to automate; good module boundaries are not.
